# periodictable
This is a DSA project implemented on c language using linked lists and stacks.The purpose of this modern periodic table project is to build a program which helps the users to update the periodic table, to add elements to any position as well as to delete elements , it also helps the users to search for properties of elements based on atomic number and search the health effects of certain elements.
This project is developed using C programming language with the purpose of storing atomic number, symbol and name and the properties of elements such as atomic mass,
electronegativity are displayed based on the users requirements. The project is implemented with the help of a sequential searching algorithm.
